# CoalOS
A top level shell with no real CPU emulation that gives the impression of a propietary 80s/90s OS running underneath.
# Installation and Usage:
## Windows:
1. Download the file named WindowsExecutable.zip
2. Unzip the file into its own directory
3. Execute System.exe in a terminal (open cmd (aka Command Promp) or Powershell, `cd` into the unzipped directory, and run `System.exe`)
4. Type either: `Open System` or `Open Classified`
5. Enjoy!
