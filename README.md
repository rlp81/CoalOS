# CoalOS
A poorly implemented top level shell with no real CPU emulation that gives the impression of a proprietary 80s/90s OS running underneath.
# Installation and Usage:
1. Open a terminal and run the command `git clone https://github.com/rlp81/CoalOS.git`
2. `cd` into the directory named CoalOS.
3. `cd` into the directory named sourcecode.
4. Run the command `python3 System.py`

# About
Code written by rlp81 (Coal#7238 on Discord), README written by and an object of shame of tehfrutcak1, and license / legal-ness thing done by the incredible Nomagno.

Please don't use this, please.
I beg of you.
It is so bad.
I wish I could hide the repo but I lack the perms to do so.
Oh God, can you save me?
